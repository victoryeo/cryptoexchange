This is the trade engine.

The simple folder contains the protobuf definition. Run this command to generate the golang code. 
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative simple/simple.proto

The engine contains the order, trade, order book, and order matching

## Components
The order_server contains the order server that reads order from grpc, and returns matching order to order client.

The order_client contains the client that sends order to order server.

The order_match contains the code to match buy order with sell order.

The tradeengine contains the order structure and functions. The tradeengine uses a multi queue order book design. Each order book is denoted by combination of orderName + orderType. There are separate buy queue and sell queue in each order book.
